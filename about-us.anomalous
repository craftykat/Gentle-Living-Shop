      <p class="dropcap blockquote yellow">We are a family striving to live a simpler life in this world. Our goal is to have a little piece of land in nature to grow our own veggies and be self-sufficient (also off-grid!). In the process, we would like to share all that we learn including crafting, sewing, soapmaking, foraging, vegan cooking, cob house building, forest gardening, barefoot walking, wood carving‚Ä¶ Join us on this beautiful journeyü•∞</p>
