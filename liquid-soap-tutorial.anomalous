    <h1>Make Liquid Soap At Home Without a Stick Blender (recipe building and tutorial)</h1>
    <hr>
    <img class="post-thumbnail img-border" src="./resources/img/liquid-soap-tutorial-feature.webp" height="601" width="600">
    <p class="dropcap">We want to share with you how we make liquid soap that is hypoallergenic and fragrance-free. This gentle soap is perfect for doing dishes and hand-washing clothes. Unlike what you might think, the final product of a liquid soap is actually in paste form. This paste is then dissolved in water to create liquid soap. We will show you our entire process from calculating the recipe, to the steps of soapmaking from start to finish, to how we dissolve the soap paste to make liquid soap.</p>
    <p>If you are new to soapmaking, please <a href="./soap-guide-part-1-basics.html">read our beginner’s guide</a> to get started and reference the <a href="./soapmaking-terms-and-definitions.html" target="_blank">soap terms and definition list</a> if you do not understand certain words.</p>

    <h3>Building the recipe</h3>
    <p>We recommend you to <a href="./soap-guide-part-2-recipes.html" target="_blank">make your own soap recipes</a> and then <a href="https://www.soapmakingfriend.com/soap-making-recipe-builder-lye-calculator/" target="_blank">double check the recipes with Soapmaking Friend</a>. Below is how we build our recipe for your reference.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Soap = Lye solution + Oil</strong></em> (this recipe will have no additives, e.g. fragrances, colourants, etc.)</p>
    <p>For liquid soap making, potassium hydroxide (KOH) is used instead of sodium hydroxide.</p>
    <hr class="halfwidth">
    <h4>Oil</h4>
    <p>We are using<strong> 300g of coconut oil.</strong> <strong>KOH saponification (SAP) value of coconut oil = 0.257</strong></p>
    <hr class="halfwidth">
    <h4>Lye</h4>
    <p><strong>KOH we have has a purity of 90%.</strong></p>
    <p>Superfat – we will add <strong>1% superfat</strong> in the form of a lye discount.</p>
    <p><strong>KOH needed in recipe:</strong></p>
    <pre>oil x SAP value ÷ purity x (100% - superfat)</pre>
    <pre>300g x 0.257 ÷ 90% x (100% - 99%) = 84.81g</pre>
    <hr class="halfwidth">
    <h4>Water</h4>
    <p>When we experimented, a ratio of 1.5 : 1 resulted in oil and lye separation at first and after mixing further the batter seized to become very hard chunk. It did relax into a workable paste after resting overnight. Therefore, we do not recommend you use such a low water : lye ratio for this 100% coconut oil liquid soap.</p>
    <p><strong>Water : lye ratio we will use is 3 : 1. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Water needed in recipe:</strong></p>
    <pre>KOH x (water : lye ratio)</pre>
    <pre>84.81g x (3 : 1) = 254.43g</pre>
    <hr class="halfwidth">

      <h4>Final recipe</h4>
      <p class="text-center">Coconut oil = 300g</p>
      <p class="text-center">Potassium hydroxide (90% purity) = 84.81g</p>

          <h5>Steps</h5>

            <li>Build your <strong>recipe</strong> and <a href="https://www.soapmakingfriend.com/soap-making-recipe-builder-lye-calculator/" target="_blank"> use Soapmkaing Friend</a> to double check your math</li>
            <li>Prepare your <strong>workstation</strong> with all your tools, materials and safety gear</li>

            <li>Weight out the exact amount of <strong>water</strong> into a lye safe container, set it aside</li>
            <li>Weight out the exact amount of <strong>oil</strong> into a lye safe container, set it aside</li>
            <li>Put your <strong>safety gear</strong> on (make sure you are also wearing long sleeves)</li>
            <li>Weight out the exact amount of <strong>KOH</strong> into an empty and dry lye safe container</li>
            <li>Slowly <strong>pour KOH into water</strong> (never the other way round), cover it with a lid to protect yourself from the fumes</li>
            <li>After KOH and fully dissolved, slowly <strong>pour lye solution into the oil and stir</strong>. At first, colour of oil will become creamier, and then the consistency will gradually turn thicker.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes of hand stirring (it will take longer for bigger batches and if room temperature is low), the soap batter will reach a thick pancake batter like consistency and a white colour. This is a good place to stop stirring as the oils have fully emulsified with the lye.</li>
          </ol>

            <li>Dishes and tough stains – 1 : 1, soap paste : water ratio (e.g. 100g of soap paste with 100g of water)</li>

          </ul>
          <p>Let the soap paste dissolve in water overnight. It may appear cloudy at first, but the liquid will clear up (sequester) in a few days. However, if you used hard water to dissolve the soap paste, it may remain cloudy.</p>
